Some interesting 


setting up a new raspberry pi4 (mine is running "Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)"):

security.yml sets up some typical security features
cups.yml sets up a print and scan server
bridged-wap.yml turns the pi4 into a Bridged Wireless Access Point



utilities:
service-status.yml - check services
status.yml - check general status
shutdown.yml - shutdown the server
